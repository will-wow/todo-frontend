# todo-frontend

A simple TypeScript React todo app. Just a testbed for different backends and testing tools.

Demo version with localStorage persistance:

[todo-react-testing.surge.sh](https://todo-react-testing.surge.sh/)

## Prerequisites

- Node 12.6.0
- Yarn 1.17.3 or higher

## Quick start

Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Start the server:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will launch the app at:

<http://localhost:3000/>

## Task reference

- **`yarn start`** starts the development server listing on port 3000. Changes to .js or .scss files automatically refresh in the browser.
- **`yarn test`** runs tests in "watch" mode, automatically focusing on tests or code that were modified since the last commit. Press the `a` key after the test runner has started to watch all tests in the project.
- **`yarn test:coverage`** runs all tests, prints coverage stats, and then exits.
- **`yarn format`** autofix with eslint and prettier
- **`yarn build`** generates an optimized bundle of the app into the `build` directory, suitable for deployment.
- **`yarn deploy`** send the build directory to surge
